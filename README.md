📚 **Book Recommendation System**


Personalized Book Recommendations Using Machine Learning


🔗 Repository: parthvasu2004/book_recommendation_system_p


🚀 Overview


The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that provides personalized book recommendations based on user preferences. It leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest books similar to user interests.


🛠️ Features


✔️ Personalized Recommendations: Recommends books based on user ratings and popularity.
✔️ Machine Learning Model: Uses pre-trained models stored in .pkl files for efficiency.
✔️ Flask Web Application: User-friendly interface for generating recommendations.
✔️ Efficient Data Processing: Uses preprocessed datasets for quick predictions.
✔️ Live Deployment: Hosted on Render for public access.

🎯 Model & Training


Dataset: Utilizes book ratings, user data, and book metadata for training.
Algorithms:
Collaborative Filtering: Suggests books based on user interactions.
Content-Based Filtering: Uses similarity scores to recommend books.
Preprocessing:
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Creating a pivot table (pt.pkl) for collaborative filtering.
Computing similarity scores (similarity_scores.pkl).


🔗 Live Deployment
